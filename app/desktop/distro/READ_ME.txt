Installation instructions for TrainSMART Desktop

.NET version 2.0 is required to run. 
If you get an error immediately upon opening the application, you need .NET 2.0 or newer. Computers that are older than 5 years, may only have .NET 1.1 installed.

.NET can be downloaded from our site under MY ACCOUNT, if you navigate to Get Required .NET. .NET can also be obtained from Microsoft's website.

If you plan on distributing the application to more than one computer, DO NOT run the application prior to installation on the destination computer(s). The first time the application is run, a unique ID is generated for that particular instance of the application. If you were to run the application first, then distribute it, this assigned ID will not be unique and will break the data sync process.
If you would like to test the application prior to deploying it to the field, you can make a copy of the clean database file by following these steps:
1) Unzip the archive .zip
2) Copy the trainsmart.active.sqlite file. Save it as trainsmart.active.backup.sqlite 
3) Run the application. Test. Close it.
4) Replace trainsmart.active.sqlite with the backup copy.

Changing the regional/geographical hierarchy on the web version of the application will require reinstallation of the desktop app (re-download and install).
