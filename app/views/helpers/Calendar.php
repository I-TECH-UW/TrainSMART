This is a PHP class used to create and display calendars in many forms.

The class can display calendars in the following formats:

Small month plain
    This will display a small calendar of a month.

Small month with events.
    This will display a small calendar of a month.  An array of dates can be given
    to indicate events.  The dates for these events will be highlighted with
    mouseover titles to display the events.

Large month plain
    This will display a plain full page calendar of a month.

Large month with previous and next month.
    This will display a plain full page calendar with small month plain calendars
    showing the previous month on the left of the header and the next month on
    the right of the header.

Large month with events.
    This will display a full page calendar of a month.  An array of dates can be
    given to indicate events.  The date cells for these events will show the events
    for that day.

Large month with previous and next month and events.
    This will display a full page calendar with small month calendars showing
    the previous month on the left of the header and the next month on the right
    of the header.  An array of dates can be given to indicate events.  The date
    cells for these events will show the events for that day.  The dates for the
    events of the small previous and next month calendars in the header will be
    highlighted with mouseover titles to display the events.

Full year plain
    This will display a full page calendar for an entire year showing all months
    in a small plain format.

Full year with events
    This will display a full page calendar of an entire year.  An array of dates
    can be given to indicate events.  The dates for these events will be highlighted
    with mouseover titles to display the events for a given month.
Weekly with events
    This will display a weekly calendar showing every quarter hour in the day.
